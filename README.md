# mscs722-native
Project 1 for MSCS722, a native game for ios

## Jump A Ton!
The game I chose to make is called Jump A Ton!. The purpose of the game is to see how many times you can jump 
witin the given time period. The highest number of jumps recieves 1st place, etc. The idea comes from a nintendo switch game that uses
the joy cons as a jump rope. The goal was to mimic this functionality to be used on iOS. 

### Gameplay
First the game is started by pressing the jump button on the gameplay screen. The player has 15 seconds to 
jump as much as they can before the timer runs out. 
**As of right now, using the sensors functionality is not implemented and jumps are registerred by button tap.
